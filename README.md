# 🔢 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive, web-based tool that demonstrates the working of various sorting algorithms through real-time visual animations. This project helps users understand and compare how different sorting techniques operate step-by-step and how they vary in time and space complexity.

## 🚀 Features

- Visualizes popular sorting algorithms with animations
- Custom input for arrays
- Play, Pause, and Reset buttons for controlling animations
- Speed control slider for animation
- Displays Time and Space Complexity
- Clean and user-friendly UI

---

## 📌 Sorting Algorithms Implemented

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Visualization Logic:** JavaScript-based DOM manipulation  

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. The user inputs a list of numbers or generates a random array.
2. The selected algorithm sorts the array with each step visualized using animations.
3. Controls allow the user to manage the animation flow and understand each step.
4. Time and space complexities are displayed dynamically during the process.
